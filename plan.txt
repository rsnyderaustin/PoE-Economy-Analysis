    Okay so the plan is to ingest items from the PoE Trade API. After ingesting, we
determine what items are possible to craft or even just relist for profit. Obviously
the more difficult of these two tasks is to determine what crafts should happen to maximize
profit and minimize risk. To do so, we first of all need to understand the different mods
and weights of mods that go into each item base type (btype). This data comes from
Craft of Exile / Forbidden Library Discord (CoE / FLD). Mods have different ID's between PoE Trade API
and Craft of Exile's mod data, so we need to pair up the mods between the two.

-- Program Outline:

1. Ingest PoE trade items and build a foundation of mods by base item type. This should be
updated constantly throughout the runtime of the program, but will need to be the only focus
for some time. Mods data should include item base type and item base name.
2. Build a model for predicting the price of an item.
3. Build the engine for crafting, including predicting the price of each craft outcome.
This is where pairing up CoE / FLD to Trade API mods will be necessary.
