So each item atype is completely separate from one another. Their mods don't interact, the tiers don't interact, etc.
So we need to treat each atype and its associated mods completely differently. They may contain some mods of the same ID,
they may not, etc. At its core, when synthesizing data from PoECD data and the Official Trade API, all we really care about
is filling in the mod weighting and affix type (suffix / prefix).
